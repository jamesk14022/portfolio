<ul>
	<li>Used Three.js library for visualising .STL and .OBJ files in a 3D environment within the browser, including pan/zoom and rotation. The user could choose different colours for their 3D print - these options reflected in the visualisation of their object.</li>
	<li>JQuery used for handling and validation file uploads on the client side. </li>
	<li>Integrated with the Stripe Payments product for user-friendly payment handling.</li>
